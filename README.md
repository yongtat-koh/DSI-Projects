##Project 1(P1)
In this assignment, I am to be an employee of a team in College Board - the organization that administers the SAT that tracks statewide participation. The objective is to recommend where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates. The participation rate of SAT will be assessed against ACT, which is another popular exam in the United States administered by ACT, a nonprofit organization of the sanme name. Participation rates of ACT and SAT exams for each state in the United States are examined to determine if the overall participation rates of the ACT is higher than SAT. After analysis, ACT participation rate is found to be higher than SAT for 2017 and 2018. Both SAT and ACT participation rates are inversely proportional to the SAT or ACT score.

It's found that SAT may be more difficult to score than ACT. Hence, more states send their better students to take SAT compared to ACT. Sample test papers can be given to universities to get feedback and improve their tests so that it matches the standard of ACT. We can also approach arts college and emphasize on the benefits of SAT on how it can help them assess students using only the ERW portion of SAT.

Lastly, we can focus and work on getting feedback from teachers and students from the schools taking SAT. By collecting more data, further analysis can be carried out to look at other trends such as the schools' sentiments towards SAT.
